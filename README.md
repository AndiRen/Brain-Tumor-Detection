# Analyzing the Robustness of Transfer Learning in Brain Tumor Diagnosis

## Overview

-Compares two self-built deep nerual networks with a transfer-learning model built on the EfficientNetV2B2 model.    
-All three models performed above 0.9 in both accuracy and macro F1 on the test data set.  
-However, when using a new data set of similar brain scan images, but with some novel orientations, the pretrained model vastly outperformed the self-built models.  
-[The Br35H :: Brain Tumor Detection 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection) Kaggle data set was used to train and do inital testing of the models.  
-[The Brain Tumor Classification (MRI)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri?select=Training) Kaggle data set was used to retest the models on similar, but new brain scan data.

## Conclusions

1. Transfer learning is ideal for quick, cheap, and robust prototyping.  
2. Can use prototyping to investigate research goals and identify data needs.  
3. Once research goals and data needs identified can build data infrastructure necessary to effectively train specialized models.
